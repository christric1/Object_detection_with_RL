# DRL for Enhancing Object Detection Performance
In recent years, deep learning has advanced significantly in image processing, especially in object detection. However, its performance is influenced by image quality due to factors like blurring, noise, and low contrast. To address this, our study integrates deep reinforcement learning (DDPG) with YOLOv7 for image preprocessing, enhancing detection capabilities. Experimental results indicate this combined approach outperforms using YOLOv7 alone.
